# 🔧 Scikit-learn Version Compatibility Note

## Issue Description
The trained models (`logistic_regression_model.pkl` and `preprocessor.pkl`) were created with scikit-learn version 1.6.1, but newer environments may have version 1.7.1 installed.

## Impact
- **Functionality**: ✅ Models work correctly
- **Warnings**: ⚠️ Version mismatch warnings appear during loading
- **Performance**: ✅ No performance impact

## Solution
The `requirements.txt` file pins scikit-learn to version 1.6.1 to ensure compatibility:

```
scikit-learn==1.6.1
```

## Recommended Setup
For a clean environment without warnings:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install exact versions
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Retrain models** with current scikit-learn version
2. **Accept warnings** (functionality unaffected)
3. **Pin environment** to scikit-learn 1.6.1 (current approach)

**Status**: 📋 Documented - Version pinned in requirements.txt
